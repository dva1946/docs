October 2nd 2022: Documentations for WpAppsForThat.Com

Each repository documentation should have a folder within this repository.

One of my styles of documentation is creating a PDF of source code and doing markup within the pdf.

On more complex Apps, I may also do a more detailed installatinn and usage document.
